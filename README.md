# wordguess-node

This assignment was designed to teach how to use node.js and javascript to better understand constructors and inheritance, via the mechanism of creating a node version of a word guess game.

The input and output were taken from and delivered to the termnal CLI.

One aspect of developing this application is that I discovered that there is a node application that allows the Inquirer prompts and responses to be colourized.

Pretty awesome, in a 1980s DOS kind of way.
